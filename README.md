# Are-You-Smarter-Than-Chim-
Game
## About

This is a website created to represent a visual representation of a memory test 
created by Tetsuro Matsuzawa to train chimpanzees memory ability. 
Chimpanzees can do this test within 0.5 seconds to memorize the numbers. 

And yes it's possible to cheat this game but why would you do that, to prove to your friends that you are better than chimpanzees? Because you aren't.
